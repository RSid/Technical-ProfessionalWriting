# Developer readme - WIP
Hi! This doc is intended as a ReadMe for, well, me, or more specifically me as a developer. The concept is borrowed from the idea of [manager readmes](https://medium.com/@kawomersley/why-and-how-to-share-your-manager-readme-plus-heres-mine-8a4fe188ee1b). Like managers, developers bring a series of priorities and assumptions to the table, as well as a unique working style. This is my effort to make mine maximally transparant. 

## Working style

I particularly value:

* candor
* empathy
* efficiency
* humor

in myself and the people I work with. 

I respond well to compliment sandwiches, frequent feedback, and collaborative teams. I like learning new things, and generally take more joy in being able to do a little bit of everything than in focusing on only one thing.

I've found that teams that adhere fairly closely to Agile methedologies are more efficient and get along better. SCRUM and Kanban are both great, and retrospectives and refinements lead to strong teams and good software.

## Code values

* Readable and maintainabile
  * Minimize cycolomatic complexity
  * Thoughtful, descriptive naming of variables, methods, class, files, etc
  * Prefer commonly-used methods/approaches to known problems over 'clever' ones, unless there's a good reason not to
* Verifiable and observable
  * TDD is negotiable, but having a test suite isn't. Some version of BDD is ideal
  * Error tracking and logging should be part of the development process, not an afterthought
* Infrastructure is code
  * Not everyone needs perfectly automated CI/CD, but isn't it nice? As you scale, it becomes a must
* Domain driven design
* Object oriented and functional programming are both cool, for different jobs
