# Developer readme - WIP
Hi! This doc is intended as a ReadMe for, well, me, or more specifically me as a developer. The concept is borrowed from the idea of [manager readmes](https://medium.com/@kawomersley/why-and-how-to-share-your-manager-readme-plus-heres-mine-8a4fe188ee1b). Like managers, developers bring a series of priorities and assumptions to the table, as well as a unique working style. This is my effort to make mine maximally transparant. 

## Working style

I particularly value:

* candor
* empathy
* efficiency
* humor

in myself and the people I work with. 

I respond well to compliment sandwiches, frequent feedback, and collaborative teams. I like learning new things, and generally take more joy in being able to do a some of everything than in focusing on one narrow specialty. Mentoring newer developers is something I enjoy and prioritize.

I've found that teams that adhere fairly closely to Agile methedologies are more efficient and get along better. SCRUM and Kanban are both great, and retrospectives and refinements lead to strong teams and good software.

## Things I like and am good at

* Organizing people, projects, and processes
* Designing systems (technical and otherwise)
* Working with people
* Having a breadth of responsibilities and skills, with some amount of multi-tasking
* Interacting regularly with the big picture of my organization, thinking about value and context
* Refactoring code towards best practices
* Learning new technologies & paradigms

## Things I dislike

* Disorganization, lack of planning
* Domains I'm not engaged by
* Letting the perfect be the enemy of the good - shipping projects is great
* Working in isolation from others / from the greater organizational vision

## Code values

* Readable and maintainabile
  * Minimize cycolomatic complexity
  * Thoughtful, descriptive naming of variables, methods, class, files, etc
  * Prefer commonly-used methods/approaches to known problems over 'clever' ones, unless there's a good reason not to
* Verifiable and observable
  * TDD is negotiable, but having a robust test suite isn't. Some version of BDD is ideal
  * Error tracking and application logging and monitoring should be part of the development process and easy to use
* Infrastructure is code
  * Not everyone needs perfectly automated CI/CD, but isn't it nice? As you scale, it becomes more and more necessary
* Domain driven design
* Object oriented and functional programming are both cool, for different jobs
