# 👩‍💻 Learn You A Code 👨‍💻

In the course of mentoring and sharing patterns and ideas with other developers, I realized I was often searching for the same resources and articles over and over again. It seemed useful to start keeping track of them in one publicly available place in a more organized manner, so here we are!

#### Legend:

💡 - intros to a concept, may not be as useful to someone already familiar 

🏋️ - interactive activities

📓 - quick reference sheets

📚 - long reads



## Git/Version Control 🔄

* 💡 [What's Version Control?](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)
* 🏋️ [Interactive Git tutorial](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en_US). It covers basics like branching and merging, but also more complex topics like rebasing.


## Design Patterns 🗺️
### APIs
* 📓 [How to choose what http status code to return](https://www.codetinkerer.com/2015/12/04/choosing-an-http-status-code.html)
* RESTful API Design (REST)
  * 💡 [A basic API primer](https://medium.com/@mattburgess/apis-a-basic-primer-f8250602597d) Useful in my mind primarily for the clear explanation of the different 'levels' of REST, explained clearly and briefly
  * 📓 [REST resource naming guide](https://restfulapi.net/resource-naming/) There's a lot more here besides the guide that can act as a conceptual primer as well.
  * 📚 [Roy Fielding's 2000 thesis that introduced the REST pattern](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm)


### Web development
* [stub] Model View Controller (MVC)
* [Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html)


### Data analytics/pipelines
* [stub]


### General code organization/style
* [stub] Domain Driven Design
  * [5 minute overview of DDD (and a few other best practices)](https://medium.com/the-coding-matrix/ddd-101-the-5-minute-tour-7a3037cf53b8) I don't know if I love the writing style, but a clear an succinct explanation and argument for the utility of practices I think produce good code
* [stub] Object-oriented Design
* [stub] Functional Programming


## Practices 🕴️

* [Clean code](https://x-team.com/blog/principles-clean-code/) This encompasses only a handful of the principles, but I think it hits the most important in a concise way. The only one I'd say isn't an obvious always-apply is composition over inheritance, which while I often support it I don't think is universally applicable
* [stub] Test Driven Development (TDD)
* [stub] Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
* [What makes a good test?](https://github.com/RSid/Technical-ProfessionalWriting/blob/master/WhatMakesAGoodTest.md) Warning: my opinions here, synthesized from a few different sources with the intent to be brief and digestable rather than a thorough argument for each point.
* [Peer code review best practices](https://smartbear.com/learn/code-review/best-practices-for-peer-code-review/)
* [Writing PRs that are pleasant/easy to review](https://medium.com/@greenberg/writing-pull-requests-your-coworkers-might-enjoy-reading-9d0307e93da3)
* [What makes a good pull request?](https://github.com/RSid/Technical-ProfessionalWriting/blob/master/PullRequests.md) Again, caveat emptor, my own opinions succinctly stated
